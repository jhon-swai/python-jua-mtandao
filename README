Tanzania has a lot of communication networks such Vodacom, Tigo, Airtel and Ttcl  that provide varying services but most importantly they favour their own customers. This means that it will be relatively cheaper to communicate with someone on the same network.
Most people are always wondering which network the person they want to contact belongs to. 
This is where Jua mtandao app comes in. It will take in any number and tell you which network is it from.
The aim of this app is to make things easier and avoid unnecessary frustrations. Further modification are to come.
Hope you fin it useful.
